      <description>Written by: Ed Orlando, Data ScientistProject DescriptionReducing turnover in an organization is vital. Using a fabricated data set, this project utilized advanced machine learning methods that accurately predicted which employees have a higher or lesser likelihood to leave. This project also displayed which key features influenced Employee Attrition at both the macro level as well as at the individual employee level.AcknowledgementI want to thank and give credit to Matt Dancho, CEO and Founder of Business Science University.</description>
