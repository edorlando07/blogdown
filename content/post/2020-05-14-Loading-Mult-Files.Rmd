### Example

Let's say you have multiple files that you want to load into R and include the folder and file name in the final tibble.  In this example, we have Spotify playlist data that was downloaded using [Exportify](<https://rawgit.com/watsonbox/exportify/master/exportify.html>).  Each playlist was previously converted to .xlsx files and placed into the appropriate genre's folder (see below).

Each playlist folder includes multiple .xlsx playlist files.  The example below shows the contents inside the Country genre folder.

### Load Libraries

The tidyverse and readxl libraries are the only ones required for this quick tutorial.

```{r, echo=TRUE, results="hide", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

<br>

### View Files in Each Folder

First, we can create a function that lists the .xlsx files for each genre folder. The function utilises the **base::list.files()** that will list each file under a particular folder.

```{r, echo=TRUE}

list_files_in_folder <- function(genre) {
    
    list.files(path = str_c("Data_Sources/2020_05_14_Loading_Mult_Files/Genres/", genre),
                          pattern = "*.xlsx", 
                          full.names = T) %>% 
    tibble::enframe()
    
}
```

<br>

For example, if we want to view all the files in the Country genre folder, we can easily pass "Country" into the function.

```{r}
list_files_in_folder("Country")
```

<br>

Next, we will create a genre list that includes all three genres.  This step will allow us to map the **list_files_in_folder** function to multiple genre folders later on.
```{r}
genre_list <- c("Country", "Hip_Hop", "Rock")
```

<br>

This list is mapped into the function listed below.  The final result includes a tibble with all .csv files in all the folders we specified above.

```{r}
playlist_tbl <- genre_list %>% 
  map_df(list_files_in_folder)
```

<br>

The value column is extracted from the tibble above and transformed into a list.

```{r}
playlist_list <- playlist_tbl %>%
  select(value) %>%
  as.list()

playlist_list$value
```

<br>

The **playlist_list$value** can then be mapped into the function below which will read each .csv file and add the file name into a tibble.

```{r results="hide", warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
song_tbl <- playlist_list$value %>% 
    
    map_df(function(add_file_name)
        
        read_excel(add_file_name) %>%
            
            mutate(playlist_name = gsub(".xlsx", 
                                        "", 
                                        basename(add_file_name))) %>%
            mutate(filename = add_file_name)
    )
```

<br>

```{r}
song_tbl %>% 
  select(-`<U+FEFF>Spotify URI`) %>%
  glimpse()
```

<br>

```{r}
song_tidy_tbl <- song_tbl %>% 
            separate(col    = filename, 
                     into   = c("Folder_01", "Folder_02", "Folder_03", "Genre", "Playlist"),
                     sep    = "/",
                     remove = FALSE)
```


```{r}
song_tidy_tbl %>% glimpse()
```
