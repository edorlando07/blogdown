<h3>Author: Ed Orlando</h3>
<p>First, I want to give a shout out to the team at <strong><a href="https://www.whitelodging.com/">White Lodging</a></strong>. Our team leader <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-hutsler-a9104038/">Adam Hutsler</a></strong> and Business Intelligence Manager <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-thomas-917291a1/">Max Thomas</a></strong> are always coming up with creative ways to solve complex problems and create business value using <strong><a href="https://www.tableau.com/">Tableau</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://rstudio.com/">R</a></strong>. I also want to thank former Business Intelligence team members, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-williams-2b63854b/">Alex Williams</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/onetroyhill/">Troy Hill</a></strong> for their encouragement and advice throughout the years.</p>
<p>I was also inspired to create this data science blog based on the work performed by <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/">Matt Dancho</a></strong>. His online learning platform <strong><a href="https://www.business-science.io/">Business Science University</a></strong> (BSU) walks you through how professional data scientists set up, build, and deploy bleeding edge machine learning models using <strong><a href="https://rstudio.com/">R</a></strong>.</p>
<p>In addition, another BSU student, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdex/">Jason Dexter</a></strong>, recently created his blog which gave me motivation to formally document some of my own personal projects. His blog can be viewed <strong><a href="https://www.exploringdata.org/">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This blog will help me organize my data science projects as well as sharpen my communication skills. Stay tuned for more posts and analysis. If you have questions or comments, please send me a message <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/edorlando07/">here</a></strong>.</p>
